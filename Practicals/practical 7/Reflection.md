# What I Learned
Through creating a job listing table using HTML, I gained practical experience with structuring tabular data for clear presentation. Designing the table with headers for job title, company, location, and application deadline helped me appreciate the importance of labeling and organization in making data easy to scan and understand.
# CSS Styling Experience
I applied CSS properties to style the table with borders and padding to improve readability and aesthetics. This project highlighted best practices such as using border-collapse for clean borders and padding within table cells to provide breathing room for data content. I also saw how consistent styling across header and body cells enhances the professional look of the table.
# Challenges Faced
Initially, I struggled to maintain consistent spacing and alignment while ensuring the table remained neat and accessible. Making the table responsive for various screen sizes was a challenge, as tables tend to overflow on small displays. Learning to use CSS techniques for responsive tables, such as overflow handling and media queries, became essential.
# Solutions and Improvements
I addressed layout issues through CSS refinements and by structuring the table semantically using <thead> and <tbody>. Using clear class names helped target styles precisely without affecting other page elements. I also explored responsive design approaches to improve table usability on mobile devices.
