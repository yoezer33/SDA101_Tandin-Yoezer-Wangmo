# Introduction
Reflection on Learning DOM Manipulation
Working on the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation project was both engaging and highly insightful, offering me a firsthand understanding of how JavaScript interacts dynamically with HTML elements to change content, modify styles, and alter the structure of web pages. Throughout this project, I learned key techniques for accessing and modifying webpage elements using JavaScript methods such as getElementById() and getElementsByClassName(). It was fascinating to observe how a few lines of JavaScript could transform a static webpage into a highly interactive and visually responsive experience.
One of the most valuable takeaways was learning to respond to user actions in real time through event listeners. For example, I implemented buttons that, when clicked, could change the page title, add new elements to the DOM, or remove existing ones, effectively making the web page interactive and dynamic. This experience reinforced my appreciation of the DOM as a vital bridge between the static HTML document structure and the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript. Moreover, I learned how to create new HTML elements dynamically with createElement() and apply styles or classes using methods like classList.add(), which is essential for building flexible, user-driven interfaces.

# Challenges and Resolutions
A notable challenge I faced was understanding the hierarchical relationships that exist within the DOM, specifically how parent-child nodes interact. Initially, I was uncertain about how to precisely remove or manipulate specific elements without inadvertently affecting others in the DOM tree. Through careful trial and error, combined with reading documentation and observing debugging outputs, I learned to effectively utilize properties such as first element child, last element child and parent element to navigate and modify the DOM precisely .Using the browser’s developer console to visualize the element hierarchy was especially helpful, allowing me to see in real time how JavaScript traverses and modifies the DOM structure.
