# Main Concepts Applied
In this practical project, I engaged deeply with several core aspects of user interface design and development using Figma. I began by creating a complete interface from scratch, starting with low-fidelity wireframes and gradually progressing to high-fidelity mockups. Throughout this process, significant attention was paid to visual details such as color schemes, typography choices, and spacing, all of which contribute to building an aesthetically pleasing and coherent design.One of the key interactive features I developed was the drop-down menu. Implementing this element required not only organizing navigation items intuitively but also making the menu interactive to enhance usability and improve the overall user experience. The menus were designed to respond to user actions fluidly, ensuring an engaging and realistic interaction.Component-based design was another crucial element of this project. I designed reusable components including buttons, cards, and icons, which helped maintain visual consistency across the interface. Utilizing components allowed for efficient updating of elements across the project, saving time and reducing errors.Auto layout features in Figma were extensively used to structure elements logically, maintain consistent spacing, and allow the design to adapt flexibly when adjustments were needed. This also facilitated the creation of responsive designs that seamlessly scale and rearrange themselves to accommodate various screen sizes, delivering a consistent user experience across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.The prototyping phase involved linking frames and designing user interactions to simulate real user flows. This helped visualize how the interface would behave in a live application, making it easier to detect usability issues and optimize navigation paths.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in translating design concepts into interactive, user-friendly interfaces. I deepened my skills in building reusable components and understood the importance of maintaining design consistency across an entire project. Auto layout and responsive design techniques enhanced my ability to create flexible layouts that work on multiple device types, an essential aspect of modern UI design.
I also learned the critical role of prototyping in UX design, allowing designers to validate workflows and interactions before development begins. This practice not only helps identify potential usability problems but also strengthens communication between designers and developers by providing an interactive visual representation of the final product.

# Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them
Initially, creating an interactive drop-down menu was challenging due to my limited familiarity with Figma’s prototyping and overlay features. By experimenting with these features and following tutorials, I managed to implement a smooth, intuitive menu that closely mimics real-world use.Designing components consistently posed its own challenges. At the start, inconsistencies in elements like buttons and cards made the interface feel disjointed. I overcame this by creating and adhering to a set of reusable components, ensuring uniformity and simplifying future updates.Implementing auto layout and achieving fully responsive designs required understanding how elements behave under resizing and how constraints affect layout. I faced difficulties ensuring that components stayed properly aligned and spaced when frames were resized. Repeated experimentation and review of auto layout settings gave me a strong command of these features, helping me create robust responsive designs.Finally, prototyping the complete user flow helped me visualize the end-user experience, guiding iterations that enhanced the design’s usability and functionality.
