This project demonstrates the comprehensive process of designing a user interface in Figma, taking it from initial wireframes through to high-fidelity visual designs and finally to interactive prototyping. The primary focus throughout was to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface while simultaneously honing critical Figma design and prototyping skills. Key features developed during the project included wireframing, drop-down menu creation, reusable components, auto layout usage, responsive design, and realistic prototyping.
I started the design process by creating low-fidelity wireframes to outline the structure, layout, and navigation flow. These wireframes proved invaluable in planning the user journey and identifying potential usability issues early, before investing time in detailed visual styling. Developing the high-fidelity designs from these wireframes involved careful attention to visual elements such as color schemes, typography, and spacing, ensuring both aesthetics and functionality were balanced.
One of the standout interactive features was the drop-down menu, which enhanced navigation by neatly organizing options and improving overall usability. Implementing this component involved linking overlays and frames within Figma’s prototyping interface to simulate smooth, realistic user interactions.
Designing reusable components—buttons, cards, icons, and other UI elements—was a pivotal aspect of maintaining visual consistency throughout the project. This component-based approach also enabled more efficient updates across the interface and ensured a cohesive look and feel.
Auto layout features were extensively leveraged to control spacing, alignment, and positioning. Mastering these tools was essential for creating responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes using constraints and flexible element arrangements.
Initially, I underestimated the value of wireframing but soon realized it played a crucial role in not only planning the static layout but also in contemplating future design scalability via auto layout. The early wireframes made it easier to experiment with navigation placement and content hierarchy before being distracted by colors or styling. Challenges included determining optimal menu and content block positions, which wireframing allowed me to tackle effectively.
During the transition to high-fidelity design, creating and managing components ensured consistency and streamlined edits. While the drop-down menu prototype initially failed to behave as intended, systematically linking overlays and frames resolved these issues and created a smooth experience. Responsive design posed difficulties because certain elements did not scale intuitively at first; through persistent experimentation with constraints and auto layout settings, I developed fluid designs adaptable to various device sizes.
