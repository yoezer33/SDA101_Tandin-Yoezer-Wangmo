# Key Features:
Wireframing: Developed basic low-fidelity wireframes to plan the overall structure, layout, and navigation flow of the interface before progressing to detailed designs. These wireframes facilitated early visualization of the user journey and helped identify potential usability concerns at an initial stage.
# How to Use:
Access the Figma file through the provided shared link or via the Figma application.
Explore the different Pages available, including Wireframes, Components, and Prototype sections.
Enter Prototype Mode to interact with the drop-down menus and navigate through simulated user flows.
Inspect and reuse components for maintaining consistency throughout the design.
# Instruction:
Select a page from an online platform and replicate its structure in Figma, applying the design principles and techniques learned during the course. Begin by creating wireframes for several pages, focusing strictly on layout and structural elements without incorporating the actual content of the website.
