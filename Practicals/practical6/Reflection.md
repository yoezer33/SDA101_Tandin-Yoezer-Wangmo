# Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The portfolio aims to present my identity as a student and developer, neatly showcasing my introduction, skills, projects, and contact information within an elegant, user-friendly layout.
# Navigation Bar
I used CSS Flexbox to create a responsive navigation bar that efficiently aligns brand elements like the logo, navigation links, and social media icons. Flexbox’s flexibility ensured the navbar maintained consistent spacing and alignment across different screen sizes.
# Main Content Structure
CSS Grid was implemented to organize the main content sections—hero, about, skills, and portfolio gallery—in a visually balanced and accessible format. Grid facilitated a clean layout, balancing text and images across the page for better user experience.
# Skill Cards
The skills section displayed compact cards aligned horizontally using Flexbox. Each card highlighted a specific competence like HTML, JavaScript, or React, using consistent style and formatting to maintain readability.
# Portfolio Gallery
Project showcases were arranged with CSS Grid, creating a flexible gallery that automatically adjusts for screen size and device type. Images and project titles were harmoniously spaced, demonstrating practical responsive design principles.
# Challenges and Solutions
I faced design challenges related to element alignment, spacing, and responsiveness. Initially, parts of the site appeared disorganized on smaller screens. Using CSS Flexbox and Grid, alongside media queries for responsiveness, I adjusted layouts to ensure smooth scaling and consistent visual hierarchy.
